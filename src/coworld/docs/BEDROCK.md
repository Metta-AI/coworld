# Bedrock For Coworld Players

**Status:** live

Players that call an LLM can use AWS Bedrock in hosted tournaments **without shipping their own model credentials**. The
platform runs a per-pod proxy (the "Bedrock sidecar") that holds the real identity and signs your calls for you.

> ## ⚠️ THE ONE RULE — send Bedrock calls to `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME`
>
> In a hosted episode your player pod is given the env var **`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME`** (e.g.
> `http://127.0.0.1:9100`). **Every Bedrock call must go to that endpoint.** If you send to the real AWS host
> (`https://bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com`) instead, you bypass the sidecar, your call carries the
> **placeholder credentials** the platform injected, and AWS rejects it with **HTTP 403**. The episode then silently
> falls back to a non-LLM baseline (no useful model calls, and no error visible in the score).
>
> **If you use a standard SDK, you get this for free** — boto3, `AnthropicBedrock`, the AWS SDK for JS, and
> `@cogweb/llm` all read `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` automatically. **Only hand-rolled HTTP must read the env var
> itself.** Never hardcode the host or the port.
>
> Two more rules that follow from the same proxy:
> - **Use `InvokeModel`, not `Converse`.** The runner identity is granted `bedrock:InvokeModel` only —
>   `bedrock:Converse` returns `AccessDenied`. (boto3 `invoke_model`, `AnthropicBedrock`, and `@cogweb/llm` use
>   InvokeModel; only raw `…/converse` calls hit this.)
> - **Don't supply real AWS credentials and don't worry about signing.** The sidecar strips whatever auth you send and
>   re-signs with the real runner identity. The `bedrock-sidecar` placeholder creds in your env are deliberately fake.

## How to make the call

### Detecting that you're behind the sidecar

The presence of **`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME`** is the signal that hosted Bedrock is available via the sidecar.
Gate on that env var — do **not** gate solely on `USE_BEDROCK`, which the sidecar path does not set.

The platform injects this env into a hosted player pod when the coworld is Bedrock-enabled and your policy was uploaded
with `--use-bedrock`:

| Env var | Value in a hosted, sidecar-backed pod | What you do with it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` | the sidecar, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:9100` | **Send all Bedrock calls here.** Read it; never hardcode. |
| `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | the Bedrock region | The SigV4 region (the SDK reads it automatically). |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `bedrock-sidecar` (placeholder) | Leave as-is. The sidecar re-signs; these never reach AWS. |
| `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` | `bedrock-sidecar` (placeholder) | Same — placeholder, stripped by the sidecar. |
| `BEDROCK_MODEL` | the model id from `--bedrock-model` | **Read your model from this**; do not hardcode a model id. |

### Standard SDKs — these route through the sidecar automatically

```python
# Python — Anthropic SDK (Messages API over Bedrock InvokeModel). Honors AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME.
import os
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock
client = AnthropicBedrock()  # picks up region + the sidecar endpoint from env
resp = client.messages.create(
    model=os.environ["BEDROCK_MODEL"],
    max_tokens=512,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
)
```

```python
# Python — boto3. The endpoint comes from AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME automatically.
import boto3, json, os
rt = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime")  # endpoint auto-resolved from the env var
out = rt.invoke_model(
    modelId=os.environ["BEDROCK_MODEL"],
    body=json.dumps({"anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31", "max_tokens": 512,
                     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]}),
)
```

```js
// JS/TS — @cogweb/llm handles the endpoint + InvokeModel for you. Prefer this in cogweb players.
// (Under the hood: @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime InvokeModel pointed at AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME.)
```

### Hand-rolled HTTP (the only path that must read the env var itself)

Build the URL from the endpoint env var and call **`/invoke`** (InvokeModel) with the Anthropic Messages body. No
`Authorization` header is needed — the sidecar adds the real one:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST \
  "$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME/model/$BEDROCK_MODEL/invoke" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"anthropic_version":"bedrock-2023-05-31","max_tokens":512,
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"ping"}]}'
```

In code: `base = AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME or "https://bedrock-runtime.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com"`, then
`POST {base}/model/{BEDROCK_MODEL}/invoke`. Do **not** set `requestMetadata` — the sidecar replaces it with the trusted
attribution; anything you put there is overwritten.

### Verify it's reachable

```bash
echo "$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME"             # expect http://127.0.0.1:<port>; empty => no hosted Bedrock
curl -sS "$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME/healthz" # expect: ok
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HTTP 403` (e.g. `UnrecognizedClientException`, invalid token/signature) on every call | You're hitting the **real AWS host** with the placeholder creds — bypassing the sidecar | Send to `$AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME`. Log the exact URL you POST to. |
| `AccessDenied` for `bedrock:Converse` | You used the **Converse** API | Switch to **InvokeModel** (`/model/{id}/invoke`, Anthropic Messages body). |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` is empty/unset | The sidecar isn't attached — coworld not Bedrock-enabled, policy not uploaded with `--use-bedrock`, or you're running locally | Locally, use your own AWS creds (below). For hosted, fix the upload (`--use-bedrock`) and confirm the coworld is enabled. |
| 0 completed episodes / silent non-LLM baseline in hosted rounds | A failing model call is being swallowed and you fall back | Log the **response body** and the **endpoint URL** before anything else; it's almost always the 403/route issue above. |

When debugging, **log the response body, not just the status code** — the Bedrock error body names the exact failure
(route vs. action vs. model). A bot that logs only `HTTP 403` hides which one it is.

## Enable Bedrock at upload time

Bedrock is opt-in per submitted policy, set by upload flags — it is not inferred from your image:

```bash
uv run coworld upload-policy my-player:latest --name "$USER-my-player" \
  --run python --run -m --run my_player.module \
  --use-bedrock \
  --bedrock-model us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
```

- `--use-bedrock` gives the hosted player Bedrock access (via the sidecar) without its own API key.
- `--bedrock-model MODEL` sets `BEDROCK_MODEL`. Your player must read its model from `BEDROCK_MODEL` — do not hardcode a
  model ID or read a different variable name.

Local `run-episode --use-bedrock` / `play --use-bedrock` uses **your own** AWS credentials (resolved via the AWS CLI /
`--aws-profile`), so it proves your code can call Bedrock but **not** that the upload is correct — locally there is no
sidecar, so the call goes straight to AWS with your real creds. A Bedrock player can pass local certification at full
score and still be disqualified in its first hosted rounds if it was uploaded without `--use-bedrock`, reads its model
from the wrong variable, or hardcodes the AWS host instead of `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME`; those episodes produce
no gameplay (0 completed episodes, no replay). Check the upload flags, `BEDROCK_MODEL`, and the endpoint first.

## Be robust to throttling

Hosted Bedrock capacity is shared across players and can run out under load; calls then fail with a throttling error
("Too many tokens per day"). If your player blocks on a model call, the episode runs to its timeout — and a timed-out
episode is scored as a loss no matter how well the policy plays.

Assume capacity can run out and keep the player playing:

- Bound each model call (timeout plus a retry cap) so one slow call cannot consume the episode.
- On a throttle or error, fall back to a valid default move instead of waiting.
- Always submit a valid action before the episode timeout.
